# ImgLoader

Small prototype of a form to upload images to a database in Liveview.

Included are:

- A schema to store pictures in a database
- A form implementation that takes files
- The Liveview that allows for file upload and storing, with an example of the handling of the form submission.

_Apologies in advance for the ugly UI. Only for demonstration purposes (unless you want world's ugliest online picture album)._
